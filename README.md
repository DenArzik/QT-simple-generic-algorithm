# Qt-simple-generic-algorithm
Just a simple demonstration of generic algorithm 

In that algorithm there is a hardcoded funtion. Code generates random initial values in runtime for each point and then tries to adjust the points which happened to be the most far away from its function value. That cycle repeats untill the general offset of the points is smaller than Accuracy value.
